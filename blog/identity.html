          <p>
            I stopped buying fast fashion after seeing the negative impacts it
            has in the environment and decided to thrift most of my clothes, I
            enjoy thrifting now its now a hobby of mine and I’ve been sharing my
            hobby with the people around me.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Growing up, seeing my parents work hard helped me become more
            self-disciplined. My friends from different cultural backgrounds
            exposed me to different parts of the world which helped me to
            respect different cultures.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Being able to manage my time will allow me to effectively learn and
            not procrastinate.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
            development. How might these affect your learning journey?
          </h2>
          <p>
            My biggest hurdle is communication I’m not a chatty person, and this
            hinders me by not being able to communicate my ideas to other peers
            or explain the problem that I’ve been stuck on I’m working on honing
            my communication skills.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
            others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
            tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
            what other strategies you would try now and why.

          <p>
            When working with others I hope to get the easy parts and still end
            up being the anchor of the team I’ve been trying to challenge myself
            with harder task so I can pick up my own weight and contribute.
