              What is your long-term goal or career pathway?
            </h2>
            <p>
              My goal is to become a full stack developer and make nice looking websites while losing track of time changing 1 pixel to make it look aligned.
            </p>

            <h2>
              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
            </h2>
            <p>
              A strength of mine is time management I’m able to learn effectively and reliably.
            </p>

            <p>
              A limitation of mine would be trying to make my website perfect David has told us about the saying Don’t Let “Perfect” Be the Enemy of “Good” I had lost myself in the rabbit hole of trying to make everything perfect I should get all the work done first and then dive into it after.
            </p>

            <h2>
              What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </h2>
            <p>
              I would really like to develop my communications skills. 
            </p>


            <h2>
              An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.
            </h2>
            <p>
              I manage the workload by setting a timeframe for when I study, I start at 9 and finish in the afternoon. I try to get the sprint done as quickly as possible so I can play games for the rest of week.
            </p>

            <h2>
              What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
            </h2>
            <p>
              When things build up, I’d take a break to play games or watch videos.
            </p>

            <h2>
              A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            </h2>
            <p>
              I will start researching the problem I’m stuck at and if I can’t find out the problem within 30 minutes I will message one of the facilitators to help
            </p>

            <h2>
              A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
            </h2>
            <p>
              I expect the facilitator to simplify difficult concepts making them easier to understand.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
            </h2>
            <p>
              I value spending time with friends and family. I would set aside evenings and weekends for these activities, ensuring they don't interfere with my studies.
            </p>
